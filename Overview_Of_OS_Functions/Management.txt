Process Management
Process: a unit of work on the system
Program vs Process:
	Program: is a set of instructions (a passive entity)
	Process: a program in execution (an active entity)
 
Process Managament

For Computer counts as milisecond, microsecond. 

IPC

Two modes of execution
	User mode: When a process is executing
	System mode When the OS is executing

Ex: Typical process execution case:

Why two modes?
	To protect OS from the errant programs/users
	To protect errant users/programs from each other.

To know what mode the system is currently in, CPU maintains a mode bit
	set to 0 when in system mode.
	set to 1 when in user mode

Main memory (RAM) - 
Secpmd memory (Hard disk)
